# Cogito Books

_Cogito Books_ is a fictional B2C online bookstore. The site will be targeted towards people who are interested in reading and buying books. It provides an easy-to-use interface where a user can easily find a book by filtering or searching, and make a purchase with or without registration.

The main goal of this project is to demonstrate my full-stack knowledge(HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python/Django, relational database and Stripe payments) in a real-world context.

__Note__: The site is for educational purposes only. To simulate a payment, please use a _Stripe_ test card number 4242 4242 4242 4242 with any three-digit CVC and a valid future date.
